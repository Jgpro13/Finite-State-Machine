            "['Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.  The goal is a computer capable of \"understanding\" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.\\n', 'Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.\\n', 'Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.\\n', \"The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.\\n\", \"Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[6]\\n\", 'In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[7][8] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling[9] and parsing.[10][11] This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care.[12]\\n', 'In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by symbolic methods, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules, coupled with a dictionary lookup:[13][14] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.\\n', 'More recent systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules: \\n', 'Despite the popularity of machine learning in NLP research, symbolic methods are still (2020) commonly used:\\n', 'Since the so-called \"statistical revolution\"[15][16] in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning. The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora (the plural form of corpus, is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations) of typical real-world examples.\\n', 'Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks. These algorithms take as input a large set of \"features\" that are generated from the input data. Increasingly, however, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to each input feature (complex-valued embeddings,[17] and neural networks in general have also been proposed, for e.g. speech[18]). Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.\\n', 'Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.  However, part-of-speech tagging introduced the use of hidden Markov models to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to the features making up the input data. The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.\\n', 'Since the neural turn, statistical methods in NLP research have been largely replaced by neural networks. However, they continue to be relevant for contexts in which statistical interpretability and transparency is required.\\n', 'A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since 2015,[19] the field has thus largely abandoned statistical methods and shifted to neural networks for machine learning. Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term neural machine translation (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that was used in statistical machine translation (SMT).\\n', 'The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.\\n', 'Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.\\n', 'Based on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:[40]\\n', 'Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above).\\n', 'Cognition refers to \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\"[41] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.[42] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[43] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies.\\n', 'As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[44] with two defining aspects:\\n', 'Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,[46] functional grammar,[47] construction grammar,[48] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences[49] of the ACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of \"cognitive AI\".[50] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit).[51]\\n']\n",

For example, \"bark\" can mean tree bark or a dog barking; words such as these make classification difficult.', 'We can address this ambiguity within the text by training a computer model through text corpora. A text corpora essentially contain millions of words from texts that are already tagged. This way, the computer learns rules for different words that have been tagged and can replicate that.', 'Another approach used by modern tagging programs is to use self-learning Machine Learning algorithms. This involves the computer deriving rules from a text corpus and using it to understand the morphology of other words.', 'Within NLP, this refers to using a model that creates a matrix of all the words in a given text excerpt, basically a frequency table of every word in the body of the text.', 'Once this is achieved, training classifiers can now be used based on the frequency matrix. However, this approach does exclude semantic meaning and context.', 'This is used to remove common articles such as \"a, the, to, etc.\"; these filler words do not add significant meaning to the text. NLP becomes easier through stop words removal by removing frequent words that add little or no information to the text.', 'Lemmatization is another useful technique that groups words with different forms of the same word after reducing them to their root form.', 'What this essentially can do is change words of the past tense into the present tense (\"thought\" changed to \"think\") and unify synonyms (\"huge\" changed to \"big\"). This standardization process considers context to distinguish between identical words.', 'Stemming is quite similar to lemmatization, but it primarily slices the beginning or end of words to remove affixes. The main issue with stemming is that prefixes and affixes can create intentional or derivational affixes.', 'Although stemming has its drawbacks, it is still very useful to correct spelling errors after tokenization. Stemming algorithms are very fast and simple to implement, making them very efficient for NLP.', 'Quite simply, it is the breaking down of a large body of text into smaller organized semantic units by effectively segmenting each word, phrase, or clause into tokens.', 'Tokenization also allows us to exclude punctuation and make segmentation easier. However, in certain academic texts, hyphens, punctuation marks, and parentheses play an important role in the morphology and cannot be omitted. And needless to say - not all languages act the same.', 'To carry out NLP tasks, we need to be able to understand the accurate meaning of a text. Semantics refers to the intended meaning of a text. This is an aspect that is still a complicated field and requires immense work by linguists and computer scientists.', 'With words that have multiple meanings, semantics becomes increasingly difficult. For example:', '\"Alice was down in the dumps last time I saw her.\"', '\"Brent dumps the garbage every night after dinner.\"', 'In this scenario, the word \"dumps\" has a different meaning in both sentences; while this may be easy for us to understand straight away, it is not that easy for a computer.', 'Computers lack the knowledge required to be able to understand such sentences. Sarcasm, irony, and humor are the hardest to decode.', 'Other techniques used for semantics include named entity recognition, word disambiguation, and natural language generation.', 'â\\x80\\x8d', 'With Natural Language Processing, we can achieve automation in an unprecedented manner. Some common examples of using NLP to simplify tasks include:', \"If you're looking to build your own models, you should consider some of the costs associated with this.\", 'Firstly, it takes a lot of time to train NLP models. Some models can take several weeks to showcase reliable results. So if you are working with tight deadlines, you should think twice before opting for an NLP solution - especially when you build it in-house.', 'More importantly, as with all ML algorithms, the results are only as good as the data on which the model is trained. It is impossible to achieve 100% reliability with NLP unless you have a clear process in mind. Moreover, NLP technology requires an immense amount of computing power, and artificial neural networks are not close to the efficiency of the human brain - yet', 'Due to the data-driven results of NLP, it is very important to be sure that a vast amount of resources are available for model training. This is difficult in cases where languages have just a few thousand speakers and have scarce data.', 'If you want to get hands-on started with NLP, there are plenty of tools available online:', 'If you want to skip building your own NLP models, there are a lot of no-code tools in this space, such as Levity. With these types of tools, you only need to upload your data, give the machine some labels & parameters to learn from - and the platform will do the rest.', 'For example, performing a task like spam detection, you only need to tell the machine what you consider spam or not spam - and the machine will make its own associations in the context.', 'Often, people rush to implement an NLP solution without truly understanding the possibilities or limitations of Natural Language Processing. This is why it is vital to plan an implementation after some research on NLP tools and available data.
